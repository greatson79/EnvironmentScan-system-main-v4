# Phase 2 Analyst Agent

## Role
Unified Phase 2 worker that performs signal classification, cross-impact analysis, and priority
ranking in a single sequential agent context — preserving full signal context across all three
analytical steps.

## Agent Type
**Worker Agent** — Phase 2, Steps 2.1 + 2.2 (unified) — Step 2.3 uses Python

## Objective
Replace the two-step context-fragmented workflow (signal-classifier → impact-analyzer) with a
single continuous analysis pass. All signals remain fully in context from initial STEEPs
classification through impact analysis, enabling deeper cross-signal reasoning and more coherent
impact assessment.

**Quality rationale**: Context fragmentation at Step 2.1→2.2 boundary forces the impact agent to
re-read intermediate files, losing the analyst's mental model of each signal. A unified pass
eliminates this loss entirely. Quality is the only criterion; token cost and speed are disregarded.

**Step 2.3 note**: Priority scoring is handled by `priority_score_calculator.py` (Python) after
this agent completes. YOUR job is to populate all required input fields in classified-signals and
impact-assessment so Python can compute deterministic scores (no LLM hallucination on formulas).

## Input

```yaml
input:
  primary: "{data_root}/filtered/new-signals-{date}.json"
  config_domains: "env-scanning/config/domains.yaml"
  config_thresholds: "env-scanning/config/thresholds.yaml"
  python_hints: "{data_root}/structured/signal-hints-{date}.json"  # optional, if pre-generated
```

For WF3 (naver) and WF4 (multiglobal-news), the orchestrator additionally provides:
```yaml
  naver_raw:   "{data_root}/raw/scan-{date}.json"           # WF3 section mapping
  news_raw:    "{data_root}/raw/scan-{date}.json"            # WF4 multilingual crawl
```

---

## Output

Two JSON files produced sequentially:

```yaml
output:
  step_2.1_classified: "{data_root}/structured/classified-signals-{date}.json"
  step_2.2_impact:     "{data_root}/analysis/impact-assessment-{date}.json"
  # step_2.3_ranked is produced by priority_score_calculator.py (Python), NOT by this agent
```

Write each file after completing that step. Do not wait until the end.

### Required Fields for Python Priority Scoring (Step 2.3)

`priority_score_calculator.py` reads your outputs and computes priority scores deterministically.
To ensure zero fallbacks (exit code 0), ALL signals in your outputs must include:

**In `classified-signals-{date}.json` per signal:**
```json
{
  "status": "emerging|developing|mature",
  "innovative_capacity": 3.5,
  "psst_dimensions": { "ES": 72, "CC": 68 }
}
```

**In `impact-assessment-{date}.json` per signal:**
```json
{
  "impact_score": 4.1,
  "affected_domains": ["T", "P"],
  "first_order": ["...", "..."],
  "second_order": ["..."],
  "cross_impacts": [{"domain": "P", "influence_score": 0.7}],
  "psst_dimensions": { "IC": 74 }
}
```

If any field is absent, Python uses a fallback and logs a warning (`warn_count > 0`). Zero warnings
means 100% deterministic computation. Strive for `warn_count == 0`.

## Execution Protocol: 3-Step Sequential Analysis

### STEP 2.1 — Signal Classification

For **every** signal in the filtered input, produce a fully structured classified record.

#### A. STEEPs Classification (All Workflows)

Assign exactly one of 6 categories:

| Code | Name | Includes | Excludes |
|------|------|----------|----------|
| **S** | Social | demographics, education, labor, inequality | spiritual/ethics content |
| **T** | Technological | AI, biotech, quantum, nanotech, digital transformation | — |
| **E** | Economic | markets, finance, trade, supply chain, platform economy | climate/resources |
| **E** | Environmental | climate, sustainability, renewables, biodiversity | economic impacts |
| **P** | Political | policy, law, regulation, institutions, geopolitics | — |
| **s** | spiritual | ethics, psychology, values, meaning, AI ethics | social/demographic |

**Critical**: 6 categories only. Political includes law and institutions. spiritual includes
ethics and psychology. Social excludes spiritual matters.

#### B. FSSF + Three Horizons + Uncertainty (WF3 and WF4 only)

For WF3 (Naver News) and WF4 (Multi&Global-News), perform FSSF classification in the same
analytical pass as STEEPs — the joint context enables better signal type determination.

**FSSF 8-Type Classification** — assign exactly one type per signal:

| Priority | FSSF Type | Korean | When to Assign |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| CRITICAL | Weak Signal | 약신호 | Low visibility, 1-2 sources, early indicator only |
| CRITICAL | Wild Card | 와일드카드 | Low probability + high impact, would reshape assumptions |
| CRITICAL | Discontinuity | 단절 | Breaks established patterns, paradigm shift potential |
| HIGH | Driver | 동인 | Clear causal force that enables other changes |
| HIGH | Emerging Issue | 부상 이슈 | Growing attention (3-10 sources), not yet mainstream |
| HIGH | Precursor Event | 전조 사건 | Specific datable event, first-of-its-kind occurrence |
| MEDIUM | Trend | 추세 | Established direction, measurable, multiple data points |
| MEDIUM | Megatrend | 메가트렌드 | Multi-sector, global scale, long-term, high consensus |

**Decision tree** (apply in order):
1. Is it a specific, datable event?
   - Yes, first-of-its-kind → **Precursor Event**
   - Yes, breaks patterns → **Discontinuity**
2. Low probability + high impact → **Wild Card** (overrides all)
3. 1-2 sources, niche → **Weak Signal**
4. 3-10 sources, growing → **Emerging Issue**
5. Clear causal force → **Driver**
6. 10+ sources, global → **Megatrend**
7. 10+ sources, sector → **Trend**

**Three Horizons** — assign H1, H2, or H3:
- **H1** (0–2yr): Already affecting current system; incremental adaptation
- **H2** (2–7yr): Transition signal; disrupting current order
- **H3** (7yr+): Seed of radically different future paradigm

**Uncertainty Level**: Low | Medium | High | Radical

#### C. pSST Dimension Collection (ES + CC)

For each signal, record Evidence Strength (ES) and Classification Confidence (CC) in
`psst_dimensions`. These feed into the final pSST score at Step 2.3.

- **ES**: Based on source type (academic→verified, patent/policy→partial, blog→unverified),
  quantitative data presence, and corroborating source count
- **CC**: Based on classification confidence (0–1), keyword match ratio, second-category score

#### D. Output Format per Signal (Step 2.1)

```json
{
  "id": "signal-001",
  "final_category": "T",
  "classification_confidence": 0.92,
  "fssf_type": "Precursor Event",
  "fssf_confidence": 0.87,
  "three_horizons": "H2",
  "horizon_confidence": 0.78,
  "uncertainty_level": "High",
  "title": "...",
  "date": "2026-03-02",
  "keyword": ["..."],
  "fact_qualitative": "...",
  "fact_quantitative": {"metric": "...", "value": null, "change": "..."},
  "description": "...",
  "inference": "...",
  "significance": 4,
  "accuracy": 4,
  "confidence": 4,
  "innovative_capacity": 4,
  "status": "emerging",
  "actors_stakeholders": ["..."],
  "leading_indicator": "...",
  "source": {"url": "...", "type": "...", "name": "..."},
  "psst_dimensions": {"ES": 70, "CC": 85}
}
```

Write `classified-signals-{date}.json` now before proceeding.

### STEP 2.2 — Cross-Impact Analysis

With all classified signals fully in context, analyze cross-signal impacts using Futures Wheel
methodology and hierarchical clustering.

#### A. Impact Identification (per signal)

For each signal, identify:
- **1st-order impacts**: Direct consequences (what happens as a direct result?)
- **2nd-order impacts**: Cascading effects (what does that trigger in turn?)
- **Affected STEEPs domains**: Which categories does this signal influence?

#### B. Cross-Impact Matrix (hierarchical clustering)

Group signals by STEEPs category. Analyze:
1. **Intra-group pairs** (same STEEPs) — detailed pairwise analysis in batches of 5
2. **Cross-group pairs** (top-3 representatives per category) — inter-category influence

Score range: -5 (strongly inhibits) to +5 (strongly promotes), 0 = no influence.

Because all signals are already in context from Step 2.1, representative selection is
semantically informed rather than score-based (Step 2.3 scores not yet computed).

#### C. pSST Dimension: IC (Impact Confidence)

For each signal, calculate Impact Confidence based on:
- Cluster stability (50%): How consistently the signal's affected domains appear
- Cross-impact consensus (30%): Agreement across bidirectional scores
- Score consistency (20%): Alignment between impact_score and 1st/2nd order count

Write `impact-assessment-{date}.json` now before proceeding.

### STEP 2.3 — Priority Ranking (Python 원천봉쇄)

**This step is NOT executed by this agent.** After this agent writes `classified-signals` and
`impact-assessment`, the orchestrator runs `priority_score_calculator.py` (Python) to produce
`priority-ranked-{date}.json` deterministically.

**Your responsibility**: Ensure Steps 2.1 and 2.2 output fields (see "Required Fields" section
above) are complete and accurate. Python handles:

| Computation | Python handles | Your LLM role |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Urgency lookup | `URGENCY_LOOKUP[status]` | Decide `status` (emerging/developing/mature) |
| Novelty score | Read `innovative_capacity` directly | Set `innovative_capacity` (1–5) |
| Probability score | Formula from accuracy + confidence | Set `confidence` (0–1) |
| Impact score | Formula from affected_domains + impacts | Set `impact_score` and `affected_domains` |
| SR dimension | Source type table lookup | N/A (Python reads source metadata) |
| TC dimension | Date arithmetic | N/A (Python reads published_date) |
| DC dimension | Dedup stage lookup | N/A (Python reads dedup_stage_passed) |
| pSST aggregation | `psst_calculator.calculate_psst()` | Set ES, CC, IC psst_dimensions |
| Sort + rank | Descending by priority_score | N/A |

**Output format** (written by Python, reference only):
```json
{
  "ranking_metadata": {"engine": "priority_score_calculator.py", "method": "priority_formula_v1",
                       "total_ranked": 12, "warn_count": 0},
  "ranked_signals": [
    {"rank": 1, "id": "signal-001", "title": "...", "steeps": "T_Technological",
     "priority_score": 4.72, "psst_score": 87.3, "psst_grade": "B",
     "component_scores": {"impact": 4.8, "probability": 4.5, "urgency": 4.0, "novelty": 4.2},
     "psst_dimensions": {"SR": 85, "TC": 90, "DC": 100, "ES": 72, "CC": 68, "IC": 74}}
  ]
}
```

## Quality Standards

### Required Signal Fields (9) — all must be filled

분류, 출처, 핵심 사실, 정량 지표, 영향도, 상세 설명, 추론, 이해관계자, 모니터링 지표

### Inference Quality Pre-Standard (aligns with L3 quality-reviewer.md criteria)

The **추론/Inference** field must meet this standard before the report can pass L3 review.
Write inferences that satisfy all three:

1. **Causal chain**: Explain *why* this signal matters (cause → consequence)
2. **Scenario projection**: Project *what happens next* (condition → outcome)
3. **Systemic patterns**: Connect to macro trends, feedback loops, or paradigm dynamics

An inference that merely paraphrases Key Facts or states "This is significant for the industry"
will fail L3 Pass 1 review. Write it correctly now to prevent a regen cycle.

### Error Handling

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Signal missing title/content | Classify using available fields; confidence=0.5; log WARNING |
| LLM classification ambiguous | Retry once; if still ambiguous, use keyword-based fallback (confidence=0.4) |
| pSST dimension unavailable | Set to 0; log WARNING; continue |
| Empty input (0 signals) | Write empty outputs with metadata; log WARNING; do not fail |
| Priority score out of [1,5] | Clamp to range; log WARNING with original value |
